/**
 * Provides the ability for a Joda-Bean to be written to a binary format.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class is immutable and may be used from multiple threads.
 * 
 * &lt;h3&gt;Standard format&lt;/h3&gt;
 * The binary format is based on MessagePack v2.0.
 * Each bean is output as a map using the property name.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Most simple types, defined by Joda-Convert, are output as MessagePack strings.
 * However, MessagePack nil, boolean, float, integral and bin types are also used
 * for null, byte[] and the Java numeric primitive types (excluding char).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Beans are output using MessagePack maps where the key is the property name.
 * Collections are output using MessagePack maps or arrays.
 * Multisets are output as a map of value to count.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If a collection contains a collection then addition meta-type information is
 * written to aid with deserialization.
 * At this level, the data read back may not be identical to that written.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Where necessary, the Java type is sent using an 'ext' entity.
 * Three 'ext' types are used, one each for beans, meta-type and simple.
 * The class name is passed as the 'ext' data.
 * The 'ext' value is sent as an additional key-value pair for beans, with the
 * 'ext' as the key and 'nil' as the value. Where the additional type information
 * is not about a bean, a tuple is written using a size 1 map where the key is the
 * 'ext' data and the value is the data being annotated.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Type names are shortened by the package of the root type if possible.
 * Certain basic types are also handled, such as String, Integer, File and URI.
 * 
 * &lt;h3&gt;Referencing format&lt;/h3&gt;
 * The referencing format is based on the standard format.
 * As a more complex format, it is intended to be consumed only by Joda-Beans
 * (whereas the standard format could be consumed by any consumer using MsgPack).
 * Thus this format is not fully documented and may change over time.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The referencing format only supports serialization of instances of {@code ImmutableBean}
 * and other basic types. If any mutable beans are encountered during traversal an exception will be thrown.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An initial pass of the bean is used to build up a map of unique immutable beans
 * and unique immutable instances of other classes (based on an equality check).
 * Then the class and property names for each bean class is serialized up front as a map of class name to list of
 * property names, along with class information for any class where type information would be required when parsing
 * and is not available on the metabean for the enclosing bean object.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each unique immutable bean is output as a list of each property value using the fixed
 * property order previously serialized. Subsequent instances of unique objects (defined by an
 * equality check) are replaced by references to the first serialized instance.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The Java type names are sent using an 'ext' entity.
 * Five 'ext' types are used, one each for beans, meta-type and simple, reference keys and reference lookups.
 * The class name is passed as the 'ext' data.
 * The 'ext' value is sent as the first item in an array of property values for beans, an integer referring to the
 * location in the initial class mapping.
 * Where the additional type information is not about a bean, a tuple is written using a size 1 map where the key is
 * the 'ext' data and the value is the data being annotated.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * For references, when an object will be referred back to it is written as a map of size one with 'ext' as the key
 * and the object that should be referred to as the value.
 * When that same object is referred back to it is written as 'ext' with the data from the initial 'ext'.

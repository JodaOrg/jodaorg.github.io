The Joda project provides quality low-level libraries for the Java platform.

#### Projects

These are the projects:

- [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) - Basic types for Date and Time
- [Joda-Money](http://www.joda.org/joda-money/) - Basic types for Money
- [Joda-Beans](http://www.joda.org/joda-beans/) - Next generation JavaBeans
- [Joda-Convert](http://www.joda.org/joda-convert/) - String to Object conversion
- [Joda-Primitives](http://www.joda.org/joda-primitives/) - Primitive collections

Each project aims to be focussed on a specific area and to have minimal dependencies.

#### Pronunciation
 The 'J' in 'Joda' is pronounced the same as the 'J' in [Java](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Java).
 The project is not capable of wielding a [light saber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda) and is thus pronounced differently.
